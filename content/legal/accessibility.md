# **PBCEx, Inc. — Accessibility Statement**

**Effective Date:** September 10, 2025

---

## **1\. Commitment and Standard**

PBCEx, Inc. (“PBCEx,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to providing digital experiences that are accessible to the broadest possible audience, including individuals with disabilities. We aim to conform our public website, progressive web application, logged-in customer interfaces, and mobile applications (iOS/Android) to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1, Level AA (**WCAG 2.1 AA**). We actively track the evolution of WCAG and maintain an internal roadmap toward **WCAG 2.2**, prioritizing success criteria that materially affect trading, charting, authentication, and identity verification flows.

---

## **2\. Scope of Coverage**

This Statement applies to:

- Public marketing website, legal pages, and disclosures

- Web application (including charts, order tickets, wallets, checkout, and support)

- Mobile applications (iOS/Android), including in-app web views

- Logged-in support channels and knowledge-base content made available to the public or to customers

- Employee-facing tools to the extent they are used to assist members of the public

**Third-Party Content and Components.** Our services incorporate third-party content and/or components (for example, real-time market charting widgets, payment/KYC vendors, and dealer fulfillment partners for physical redemptions). Where we do not control these components, we work with vendors to meet WCAG 2.1 AA. When full conformance is not practicable, we provide an accessible alternative, substantially equivalent information, or assisted service, as described below.

---

## **3\. Program Measures**

**Design and Development Controls.** Accessibility acceptance criteria are embedded in design reviews and pull requests. Our design system enforces color-contrast tokens, visible focus indicators, and keyboard operability for interactive components and modals.

**Testing.** We combine automated checks with structured manual reviews. Automated testing (rulesets aligned to WCAG 2.x) detects common issues early; manual testing covers keyboard navigation, screen-reader interoperability (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver), zoom and reflow at 200%+, orientation changes, reduced-motion preferences, and support for platform accessibility APIs on mobile.

**Release and Change Management.** Accessibility regressions are treated as defects and prioritized commensurate with user impact and legal risk. Accessibility is a non-negotiable go/no-go criterion for features that affect account access, funding, trading, and redemption.

**Vendor Management.** We assess third-party accessibility statements and, where appropriate, request conformance information (e.g., ACR/VPAT). We provide fallbacks (e.g., data table/CSV for charts) where a vendor’s interactive component does not fully conform.

**Governance and Review.** We maintain an accessibility backlog with ownership and target dates and conduct periodic reviews. This Statement will be reviewed at least twice per year and updated upon material UI or workflow changes.

## **4\. Known Risk Areas and Specific Commitments (Exchange Context)**

**Real-Time Charts and Price Signals.** Information does not rely on color alone (e.g., “green/red”) to convey meaning. Numeric values, tooltips, ARIA labeling, and keyboard-accessible controls are provided. Users may “View as table” and download a CSV of chart data.

**Time-Limited Price Locks and Sessions.** Time limits (e.g., approximately 10-minute price locks during checkout) are disclosed before initiation. Where a disability affects input speed or device use, we will extend or re-quote without penalty and preserve form state wherever feasible. We avoid unannounced timeouts and provide clear warnings and recovery paths.

**Authentication, KYC, and Liveness.** We provide accessible alternatives to visual or dexterity-heavy challenges and avoid puzzle/CAPTCHA-only barriers. Two-factor authentication includes non-SMS options on request. Identity verification workflows are designed for keyboard/screen-reader operability and reduced-motion preferences; assisted, secure alternative channels are available when necessary.

**Motion, Focus, and Keyboard Traps.** Motion and animation respect “reduce motion” settings. Interactive elements present visible focus; dialogs and trays trap and restore focus correctly. We prohibit keyboard traps and maintain logical tab order.

**Documents and Statements.** Receipts, statements, and downloadable documents are provided in accessible formats (e.g., properly tagged PDFs or equivalent HTML). Alternative formats are available upon request.

**Color/Contrast and Zoom.** We target AA contrast in light and dark modes, maintain readability and functionality at 200% zoom and common responsive breakpoints, and support reflow without loss of content or functionality.

**Mobile Parity.** Mobile features provide parity with web functionality and support platform accessibility settings (VoiceOver/TalkBack, larger text, switch control, rotor/Actions).

## **5\. Feedback, Accommodations, and Escalation**

We welcome feedback about accessibility barriers and requests for accommodations.

**Primary Contacts**

- **Email:** support@pbcex.com

- **Phone:** \+1-833-43-PBCEX (Telecommunications Relay Service/711 accepted)

- **Accessible Web Form:** https://www.pbcex.com/accessibility-feedback

**Service Levels**

- **Acknowledgment:** We aim to acknowledge your report within **two (2) business days**.

- **Substantive Update:** We aim to provide a substantive update within **fifteen (15) business days**, depending on complexity.

- **Time-Sensitive Transactions:** If an accessibility barrier affects a time-sensitive action (e.g., a trade, transfer, or physical redemption), notify us in your message or call; we will extend or re-quote as needed and complete the action with you through an accessible channel at the price and terms you would have received absent the barrier.

---

## **6\. Alternatives and Assisted Service**

While we work to remediate any issue, we will provide substantially equivalent alternatives or assisted service **without additional cost**. Examples include: agent-assisted order placement; accessible data tables or CSV downloads where interactive charts pose barriers; and alternative verification channels where liveness/selfie steps create undue friction.

---

## **7\. Compatibility and Supported Technologies**

We design and test for current versions of major desktop and mobile browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and for leading assistive technologies (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack). Some features may require enabling cookies, JavaScript, or device accessibility settings. When a specific technology is not supported, we provide an accessible alternative or assisted service.

---

## **8\. Continuous Improvement and Non-Endorsement of “Overlay-Only” Solutions**

We treat accessibility as an ongoing obligation. Automated overlays or toolbars, if present, are used only as adjuncts and are **not** relied upon as the sole means of providing accessibility. Accessibility outcomes are validated through design, code, and user-testing—not marketing claims.

---

## **9\. Reservation of Rights and No Waiver**

Nothing in this Statement limits any rights or remedies you may have under applicable law, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and analogous state laws. This Statement does not create contractual or third-party beneficiary rights and does not waive any defenses available to PBCEx.

---

## **10\. Date of Last Review**

This Statement was last reviewed on **September 10, 2025**, and is scheduled for review no later than **March 10, 2026**, or earlier upon material change.
