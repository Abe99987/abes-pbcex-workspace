# **PBCEx, Inc. — Trading & Product Risk Disclosures**

**Effective date:** September 9, 2025

---

## **Scope (Current MVP Assets)**

- **Funding (“Vault”) assets:** PAX Gold (PAXG) and selected fiat/crypto rails used for deposits/withdrawals.

- **Synthetic metals for trading (“Exchange” ledger only):** XAU (gold), XAG (silver), XPT (platinum), XPD (palladium), XCU (copper).
  - Synthetic assets exist only on PBCEx’s internal ledger, cannot be withdrawn externally, and must be converted back to a Funding asset to exit.

---

## **Important Status & Insurance Disclosures**

- **Not a bank.** No FDIC/NCUA insurance applies to balances on PBCEx. PBCEx does not accept “deposits,” and products here are non-deposit products. Misrepresenting FDIC insurance is prohibited under 12 CFR Part 328 Subpart B.

- **Not a broker-dealer.** No SIPC coverage applies. Crypto assets and commodities are not protected by SIPA/SIPC insurance.

---

## **TL;DR — High-Impact Risks at a Glance**

- **Price volatility:** Metals, stablecoins, and crypto can move sharply and without warning. You can lose value quickly.

- **Liquidity & execution:** Quotes may widen or pause during disorderly markets. Large orders may fill at worse prices or be declined. PBCEx is the counterparty for synthetic trades in Phase-1.

- **Spread, fees & slippage:** Quotes include spread plus trading fees; effective cost may exceed targets in fast markets.

- **Custody vs. synthetic:** Funding assets (PAXG/fiat/crypto) are custodied with third parties. Synthetic metals exist only on PBCEx’s internal ledger and are non-withdrawable.

- **Hedging & basis risk:** Hedging may use commodity ETFs (e.g., SLV, PPLT, PALL, CPER) or unallocated metals. ETFs can diverge from spot; unallocated accounts add counterparty risk.

- **Stablecoin risk:** Stablecoins may de-peg, freeze, or face issuer/banking disruptions.

- **Partner & logistics:** Custodians, data providers, dealers, shippers, and payment partners may experience outages, policy changes, or insolvency.

- **Regulatory change:** Features and asset availability may change to remain compliant.

- **No guarantees:** PBCEx does not guarantee profit, liquidity, hedging, price levels, physical availability, or uninterrupted service.

## **Detailed Disclosures**

### **1\. Market Risk (Volatility)**

Commodity and crypto markets are highly volatile. Prices may gap, move on thin liquidity, or shift during stress events. You may lose all or a substantial portion of value.

### **2\. Liquidity, Execution & Price Formation**

Phase-1 uses oracle-derived prices with spreads. PBCEx is the counterparty. Quotes can widen, fills may slip, and trading may pause due to stale feeds or abnormal moves. There is no public order book.

### **3\. Spread, Fees & Slippage**

All quotes include spreads and trading fees. Effective costs vary and may change without notice.

### **4\. Custody vs. Synthetic Distinctions**

- **Funding balances:** Custodied off-platform with regulated/supervised partners.

- **Synthetic metals:** Internal ledger only. Must be converted to a Funding asset to withdraw. Partner outages may delay conversions.

### **5\. Hedging & Basis Risk**

Synthetic exposures may be hedged via ETFs or unallocated positions. ETFs can diverge from spot. Unallocated holdings carry counterparty risk. Hedge performance is not guaranteed.

### **6\. PAX Gold (PAXG)-Specific Risks**

PAXG is issued by Paxos Trust (NYDFS-regulated). Each token targets 1 oz LBMA gold. Paxos controls issuance, redemption, and fees. On-chain transfers require network fees and may be delayed by congestion.

### **7\. Stablecoin & Fiat-Rail Risks**

Stablecoins can de-peg or freeze. Banking/ACH transfers may be delayed or reversed for compliance reasons.

### **8\. Physical Redemption (Coins/Bars)**

Fulfillment uses third-party dealers and insured carriers. Quotes are time-locked. Orders may be delayed/cancelled due to inventory, KYC/AML, sanctions, or shipping issues. Market-loss fees may apply if cancelled. Taxes and duties may apply. Title and risk of loss transfer at delivery per carrier rules.

### **9\. Crypto-Asset Risks**

Crypto is volatile, lacks many investor protections, and may be subject to hacks, scams, and fraud. Transactions are irreversible.

### **10\. Data, Oracles & System Risks**

External price feeds may be stale or erroneous. PBCEx uses guards and kill-switches but may halt trading. Bugs, outages, DDoS, or cloud issues can delay access or withdrawals.

### **11\. Regulatory & Tax Risks**

Features may be restricted by jurisdiction. Tax treatment varies; users are responsible for compliance and filings.

### **12\. Conflicts, Fees & Changes**

PBCEx acts as principal for synthetic trades. Spreads, fees, and eligible assets may change without prior notice. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

---

## **Security, Controls & What We Do (and Don’t) Promise**

- **Controls:** Multi-layered security, kill-switches, withdrawal approvals, and hedging limits. These reduce—but don’t eliminate—risk.

- **Compliance:** KYC/AML screening, reliance on regulated partners, and geo-restrictions as needed.

- **No guarantees:** PBCEx does not guarantee profit, hedging performance, or uninterrupted access.

---

## **Your Responsibilities**

- Understand differences between Funding and synthetic balances.

- Review fees, spreads, and price-lock windows before trading.

- Use strong account security; beware of scams.

- Seek independent legal/tax advice and ensure eligibility under local laws.

---

## **Product-Specific Addendum**

**PAX Gold (PAXG)**

- Backed 1:1 by allocated LBMA gold held by Paxos Trust.

- Transfers subject to gas fees and Paxos policies.

**Synthetic Metals (XAU/XAG/XPT/XPD/XCU)**

- Internal ledger balances only.

- Non-withdrawable; must convert to Funding assets to exit.

- Subject to oracle risk, spread, and hedging performance.

**Stablecoins (if supported)**

- Peg depends on issuer’s reserves and banks.

- De-pegs and freezes have occurred historically.

**Physical Redemptions**

- Time-locked quotes, third-party dealers, insured carriers.

- Market-loss fees and cancellation terms apply.

- Delivery delays may occur.

---

## **Legal Notices & Investor-Protection Clarifiers**

- Not FDIC/NCUA insured.

- Not bank deposits; values can decrease.

- Not SIPC insured; PBCEx is not a broker-dealer.

---

## **Why These Risks Exist in Phase-1**

Phase-1 uses third-party custody for Funding assets, an internal synthetic ledger for conversions, oracles with spreads/fees, and fully-funded hedges (ETFs/unallocated). This reduces startup complexity but introduces dependencies and risks described above.
