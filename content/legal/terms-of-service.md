## **Plain-English Summary**

## **(not a substitute for the full Terms)**

- **PBCEx is not a bank.** Non-deposit products (metals, tokens, crypto, synthetic balances) are **not FDIC insured**, are not bank deposits, and can lose value. Some USD may be placed at partner banks; any FDIC pass-through insurance depends on the bank’s records and FDIC rules and is not automatic.

- **Phase-1 scope:** internal-ledger trading in synthetic metals; PAXG (tokenized gold) custody-only; physical delivery is fulfilled by dealer partners; checkout quotes include a 10-minute price lock.

- **US-only at launch.** You must be 18+, complete KYC/AML, and pass sanctions screening.

- **Fees and spreads** apply (see **/fees** in-app).

- **No investment, tax, or legal advice.** Markets are volatile; you are responsible for your decisions and taxes.

- **Disputes:** binding individual arbitration; **no class actions**; small-claims carve-out; 30-day opt-out; consumer arbitration costs capped per forum rules.

Consumer-critical clauses are marked with **“IMPORTANT.”**

## **1\. Scope; Contract Formation**

1.1 These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services, including trading/conversion, funding/withdrawal, price-locked checkout for physical metals, and any communication features.

1.2 By using the Services, you also accept our Privacy Policy and any product-specific terms we present in-app. If these Terms conflict with product-specific terms, the product-specific terms control for that product.

## **2\. What We Offer in Phase-1**

2.1 **Two-balance model.** Your account has a **Funding (Vault)** balance (custody-backed assets you can withdraw) and a **Trading (Exchange)** balance (internal, off-chain “synthetic” tokens for fast trading).

2.2 **Synthetic tokens.** Synthetic balances are internal ledger entries usable only on PBCEx and **cannot be withdrawn** to external wallets. To withdraw, you must convert (“realize”) back to an eligible Funding asset. **IMPORTANT**

2.3 **Gold via PAXG (custody-only).** “Real gold” holdings exist as PAXG in custody; you may move PAXG into Trading as “synthetic gold” and back again.

2.4 **Physical redemption.** When you buy coins/bars, authorized dealers (e.g., JM Bullion/Dillon Gage) act as our delivery agents to pick, pack, insure, and ship. PBCEx does **not** warehouse metals in Phase-1.

2.5 **Pricing.** Quotes derive from aggregated feeds; we apply a small spread; checkout price locks are time-boxed (Section 6).

## **3\. Eligibility, Geography & Compliance**

3.1 You must be 18+ and a US resident (Phase-1). We may geo-block states/regions without notice.

3.2 **KYC/AML.** You must complete identity verification; we may use third-party providers and may limit, suspend, or terminate access to comply with law/partner requirements.

3.3 **Prohibited users.** You may not use the Services if you are on sanctions lists, reside in embargoed regions, or were previously banned.

## **4\. Account Structure, Custody & Withdrawals**

4.1 **Funding (custody-backed).** Eligible assets (e.g., USD, crypto, PAXG) may be held with qualified custodians or partner banks in pooled/segregated accounts.

4.2 **Trading (synthetic).** Moving assets from Funding to Trading locks (or burns) the Funding asset and credits a synthetic balance; synthetic balances **cannot be withdrawn externally**.

4.3 **Withdrawals.** USD withdrawals via ACH/other rails; crypto/PAXG via custodian wallets. Network, partner, and security checks/limits apply.

## **5\. Not a Bank; FDIC Clarity**

5.1 **IMPORTANT** — Non-deposit products (metals, PAXG, crypto, synthetic tokens) are **not FDIC insured**, are not bank deposits, and may lose value.

5.2 **Pass-through insurance (USD only, if applicable).** If USD is maintained at partner banks, any FDIC pass-through coverage depends on eligibility and those banks’ records; it never applies to metals/crypto/synthetic balances.

5.3 **Advertising clarity.** We will not imply FDIC insurance for non-deposits; disclosures will be conspicuous.

## **6\. Quotes, Order Acceptance & 10-Minute Price Locks**

6.1 **Quotes & spreads.** Trade/shop quotes are based on aggregated feeds with a small embedded spread plus any posted fees.

6.2 **Price locks for checkout.** At physical checkout, the system provides a **10-minute price lock** (timestamped in-app). If you don’t confirm and pay within the window, the quote expires and must be refreshed. One active lock per user/asset may be enforced. **IMPORTANT**

6.3 **Order acceptance.** Your order is an offer; PBCEx accepts when (a) your balance is debited and (b) a dealer confirms fulfillment (for physical orders). We may cancel for errors, stale feeds, unavailable inventory, fraud, or regulatory reasons.

6.4 **Slippage & guards.** If feeds are stale or move beyond guardrails, we may cancel or requote.

## **7\. Physical Fulfillment; Title; Risk; Returns**

7.1 **Dealer-fulfilled.** Authorized dealers handle insured shipment and tracking. Valid US addresses and signature may be required.

7.2 **Title & risk.** Title to items passes upon shipment by the dealer; shipments are insured to their declared value in transit per carrier/insurer terms. Your obligations include promptly reporting loss or damage to enable claims.

7.3 **Final sales; cancellations.** Precious metals orders are generally **final after dealer acceptance** due to market volatility; we may allow limited pre-acceptance cancellation (fees may apply). **IMPORTANT**

7.4 **Incorrect/defective items.** Notify us within **48 hours** of delivery with photos; we will coordinate remedy with the dealer.

## **8\. Fees, Pricing & Spreads**

8.1 You agree to the then-current **Fee Schedule** posted in-app and at **/fees** (which may include trading commissions, embedded spreads, network fees, shipping/insurance, and restocking/cancellation fees where permitted).

8.2 We may discount or modify fees prospectively; we’ll post updates and give notice where required by law.

## **9\. Taxes; Reporting**

9.1 You are responsible for all taxes arising from your activity. We may issue tax forms as required by law and may withhold where required.

9.2 You are responsible for maintaining records sufficient for tax reporting (e.g., basis, gains/losses).

## **10\. Acceptable Use**

You agree not to: violate laws/sanctions; interfere with security/integrity; misrepresent identity; reverse engineer or scrape; use bots to manipulate pricing; create artificial volume; engage in fraud, money laundering, or other prohibited conduct. We may investigate, freeze, or reverse transactions where permitted to protect users and comply with law.

## **11\. Security; Account Responsibility**

11.2 We may impose holds, withdrawal limits, wallet allow-lists, and enhanced verification.

11.3 Report suspected compromise immediately; we may freeze or disable features to protect you.

## **12\. Market & Product Risk Disclosures**

12.1 **Volatility & liquidity.** Commodities and crypto are volatile; markets can gap and trading may be paused.

12.2 **Synthetic tokens.** Synthetic balances are internal, off-chain ledger entries usable only on PBCEx and backed by reserves/hedges; they **cannot be withdrawn externally**. **IMPORTANT**

12.3 **Hedging.** We aim to remain market-neutral via fully funded hedges when exposure exceeds thresholds; hedging reduces but does not eliminate operational risk.

12.4 **No advice.** We do not provide investment, tax, accounting, or legal advice; information may be educational only.

## **13\. Third-Party Services & Content**

13.1 Custodians, dealers, banks, data providers, carriers, and other vendors support the Services. Your use of those features may be subject to their policies; we are not responsible for third-party delays, outages, or errors.

13.2 Links and market data are provided “as-is” without warranties.

## **14\. Dormant Accounts; Unclaimed Property**

If your account is inactive for a period required by applicable law, we may escheat balances to the state after required notices. You remain responsible for keeping contact information current.

## **15\. Electronic Signatures & Communications**

15.1 **E-sign consent.** You agree to receive disclosures and notices electronically and to transact using electronic signatures/records. You may withdraw consent as described in our E-Sign disclosures (withdrawing may impair Service use).

15.2 **Notices.** We may send notices via in-app message, email, SMS, or push; update your info to stay reachable.

## **16\. Beta Features; Changes; Availability**

16.1 We may offer beta or pre-release features “as-is” and may change or discontinue elements of the Services without liability, consistent with applicable law.

16.2 We make commercially reasonable efforts to provide uptime, but outages and scheduled maintenance may occur.

## **17\. Warranty Disclaimer**

Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express, implied, and statutory (including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and uninterrupted availability).

## **18\. Limitation of Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by law: (a) we will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages; and (b) our aggregate liability will not exceed the greater of (i) fees you paid to us in the 12 months before the event or (ii) $100. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limits; those limits apply only to the extent permitted.

## **19\. Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PBCEx and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Services, to the extent permitted by law.

## **20\. Dispute Resolution — Arbitration; Class Action Waiver; Opt-Out**

20.1 **Informal resolution.** Before filing, you and we agree to try in good faith to resolve disputes within 60 days after written notice (describe the dispute, relief sought, and contact info).

20.2 **Binding arbitration.** If not resolved, disputes will be resolved by final, binding arbitration on an individual basis under the Federal Arbitration Act before **JAMS** (or **AAA** if JAMS unavailable), using the applicable consumer rules.

- **Location & costs.** The arbitration shall occur in your U.S. county of residence (or by video/phone if allowed). Consumer filing fees are capped by forum rules; the company pays the remainder.

  20.3 **No class actions; no jury trial.** You and we waive any right to participate in class or representative actions or to a jury trial. **IMPORTANT**

  20.4 **Small-claims carve-out.** Either party may bring an individual claim in small-claims court.

  20.5 **30-day opt-out.** You may opt out of arbitration/class waiver within 30 days of first agreeing to these Terms by emailing **legal@pbcex.com** with your name, account email, and a clear statement.

  20.6 **Severability.** If the class-action waiver is found unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim must proceed in court; the remainder of the arbitration provisions will still apply.

## **21\. Governing Law & Venue**

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Delaware**, excluding conflicts rules; the FAA governs arbitration. For claims not subject to arbitration, exclusive venue is the state or federal courts in **New Castle County, Delaware**, and you consent to jurisdiction there.

## **22\. Suspension; Termination**

We may suspend or terminate access at any time for risk, security, fraud, sanctions, partner, or legal reasons, or for breach of these Terms. You may close your account at any time, subject to completing pending transactions and legal holds. Certain sections survive termination.

## **23\. Changes to These Terms**

We may update these Terms by posting a revised version with a new Effective Date. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., email or in-app). Continued use after the Effective Date constitutes acceptance.

## **24\. Entire Agreement; Miscellaneous**

These Terms (plus incorporated policies) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services. If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. We may assign these Terms; you may not without our consent. Force majeure applies. Headings are for convenience only.
