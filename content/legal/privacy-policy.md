# **PBCEx Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** September 9, 2025

---

## **1\. Notice at Collection**

We collect personal information (such as identifiers like name, email, phone; financial information like account details and transaction history; internet or device activity; and sensitive personal information like government ID and last-4 SSN) when you use the PBCEx website or mobile app. We use this information to provide our services (e.g., create and manage your account, process transactions), to verify your identity as required by law, to communicate with you, and to improve security and performance. We **do not sell** your personal information or **share** it for cross-context behavioral advertising. We retain your data only as long as needed for our business and legal obligations, and you have rights to know, delete, correct, and limit the use of your data. For more details or to exercise your rights (including opt-out options and honoring of Global Privacy Control signals), please see the full Privacy Policy below.

---

## **2\. Introduction and Scope**

Welcome to PBCEx\! This Privacy Policy explains how PBCEx (“we” or “us”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information. It covers both:

- The PBCEx public website (our marketing and informational site), and

- The PBCEx iOS mobile application (which acts as a wrapper for our platform).

Our mission is to earn your trust by safeguarding your personal information and your assets. In addition to protecting your privacy, we ensure all digital asset balances on PBCEx are fully backed 1:1 by real assets or hedged equivalents—there is no fractional reserve or speculation with your funds. This means whenever you hold a synthetic token or balance on our platform, it is matched by an actual asset in custody (e.g., fiat in bank, crypto with our custodian, gold token with Paxos) or an equivalent hedge position, ensuring the safety and solvency of your holdings.

**Scope.** By using our website or app, you agree to the data practices described in this Policy. This Policy applies to information we collect from account holders, visitors, and users of our site and app. It is incorporated into our Terms of Service. If you do not agree with the practices described, please do not use PBCEx. We may update this Policy at least every 12 months (or more frequently if required to reflect changes). If we make material changes, we will notify you (e.g., via email or in-app alert). The “Effective Date” above indicates when this Policy was last updated.

## **3\. Personal Information We Collect**

We collect “Personal Information” (PI) as defined by applicable laws (including the California Consumer Privacy Act, CCPA/CPRA)—information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with you or your household. Below we describe the categories of personal information (including Sensitive Personal Information) we collect and their examples.

**Identifiers and Contact Information.** Your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, account username, and similar identifiers. We collect IP address and device identifiers for security and functionality.

**Customer Records & Account Information.** Contact details, date of birth, encrypted credentials (password/PIN), linked financial account info (e.g., via Plaid/Stripe), and communications you send to us.

**Financial & Transaction Information.** Records of holdings and transactions (deposits, withdrawals, trades), internal ledger entries, and audit trail of backing assets (e.g., PAXG with Paxos, crypto at Anchorage).

**Internet or Electronic Activity.** Technical data (IP, device, OS, browser), usage logs, click-stream, timestamps, cookies, crash logs, diagnostics, and performance data. We may use tools like Sentry and Datadog for monitoring and debugging.

**Geolocation Data.** Approximate region inferred from IP for compliance and fraud prevention. We do **not** collect precise GPS location.

**Audio, Visual, or Sensory Information.** KYC images of government ID and selfie for face-match/liveness. Biometric processing (if any) is performed by verification partners on our behalf; we do not store biometric templates.

**Professional or Employment Information.** Not collected for individual accounts.

**Inferences.** We do not build marketing profiles. Limited internal inferences (e.g., fraud-risk scores) may be used to protect the service.

**Sources of Information.** (1) Directly from you; (2) Automatically from your use of our services; (3) From third parties (identity verification partners, payment/custody partners, compliance/watchlist providers, and publicly available databases).
