────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Commitment and Scope

   By agreeing below, you consent to receive required “in writing” information from PBCEx, Inc. electronically — including agreements, legally required disclosures, notices, statements, confirmations, and updates tied to your account, trades, funding/withdrawals, and physical redemptions.

   This consent applies to the account you open with us and to any product categories you select during onboarding or later in-app. You may request paper at any time.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. Your Right to Paper Copies

   You can request a paper copy of any record we provided electronically. We’ll provide one at no charge for standard requests; we may charge a reasonable fee for excessive duplicate requests.

   How to request paper: Account → Support, email support@pbcex.com, or mail the Records address above.

   Paper copies do not withdraw your e-consent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. Hardware/Software You Need (Access & Retention)

   • Current version of a major browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox) with cookies and JavaScript enabled

   • Internet connection

   • Valid email address and/or access to the PBCEx app inbox

   • Software to read and save PDFs (any PDF reader)

   • A device and storage or a connected printer to retain copies

   If these requirements change in a way that creates a material risk you cannot access or retain records, we will notify you of the new requirements and tell you how to withdraw consent without penalty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4. Giving and Proving Your Consent (“Demonstrable Consent”)

   Before you consent, we will present this disclosure clearly and conspicuously and require you to open a sample document in the same format we’ll use (e.g., PDF) and take an affirmative action (check a box and click “I agree”).

   By completing that action, you confirm you can access and retain our electronic records in the format we use.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5. Withdrawing Consent

   You can withdraw consent at any time from Account → Communication Preferences or by emailing support@pbcex.com with subject “Withdraw E-SIGN Consent.”

   We will confirm the effective date and any service impacts (for example, we may need to pause new trading until we re-enable paper delivery). Withdrawal does not affect the validity of electronic records sent before your withdrawal became effective. There is no fee to withdraw consent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6. Updating Your Contact Information

   Keep your email, mobile number, and mailing address current in Account → Profile, or notify support@pbcex.com.

   If our email to you bounces or your phone carrier blocks SMS, we may alert you in-app and, when required, revert to paper. You remain responsible for missed communications if you do not promptly update your information.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7. Delivery Channels We Use (and Limits)

   We may deliver electronic records by:

   • In-app inbox and notifications (preferred “durable” channel)

   • Email (links or attachments)

   • SMS (short, transactional prompts that may link you back to your in-app inbox)

   Some disclosures must be provided in a retainable format at or before specific times; in those cases, we will use in-app inbox and/or downloadable PDF and will not rely solely on SMS.

   For SMS, message and data rates may apply. You can reply STOP to opt out of non-security texts; certain security-critical texts may be required to use the service.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

8. What This Consent Does Not Cover (Legal Exceptions)

   This consent does not apply to categories excluded from the E-SIGN Act, such as wills, testamentary trusts, family law notices, and certain home-secured credit notices or insurance cancellations, among others. For those, we will use paper or the legally required method.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

9. Timing Rules Still Apply

   Electronic delivery does not change when a disclosure must be provided (for example, pre-transaction or periodic statement timing under specific regulations).

   Where a regulation allows electronic delivery only with E-SIGN consent, we will obtain it as described here; where a regulation specifically permits electronic disclosures without E-SIGN consent, we will follow that rule.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

10. Record Retention & Version Integrity

    When a law requires us to retain a record, we will keep an electronic copy that accurately reflects the information and remains accessible for the required period.

    We maintain immutable versions of your signed consent and the disclosure text presented to you (including timestamp, IP, user agent, and UI language) so we can demonstrate what you saw and agreed to.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

11. Accessibility Commitments

    We strive to provide accessible electronic records. Our HTML and PDFs are intended to be readable with common assistive technologies, with proper tagging and keyboard navigation.

    If you need an alternative format, contact support@pbcex.com and we will provide an accessible copy or paper alternative without charge.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

12. Changes to System Requirements or Scope

    If our hardware/software requirements change materially, or if we expand the scope of e-delivery to new product categories, we will notify you and, if required, re-obtain your demonstrable consent before applying the change to you.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

13. Global Users — EU/UK “Durable Medium” and Other Regions

    If you are in a jurisdiction that requires a “durable medium,” we will deliver required customer communications in a form you can store unchanged for future reference (e.g., downloadable PDF or your in-app message archive with export).

    For UK/EU users, durable-medium rules apply; for other regions, we follow local e-signature and e-record standards. Where a local rule conflicts with this disclosure, local law controls and we will provide the required format.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

14. How PBCEx Implements E-Delivery (Operational Summary)

    We deliver statements, confirmations, and notices via: in-app inbox and push; email via our mail service; SMS for security and time-sensitive alerts; PDF generation for retainable copies; and audit logs that bind your consent to the exact document version.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

15. How to Consent

    Please confirm you can access and retain our records by opening the sample PDF and then selecting the checkbox and “I agree.” By doing so, you consent to receive electronic records as described above for the product categories you select.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

16. Electronic Signatures

    You agree that your electronic signature (including checking a box, clicking a button, or using any other electronic symbol or process) is your legal signature and has the same force and effect as a handwritten signature on paper for agreements and disclosures we present to you electronically.
