# **PBCEx, Inc. — Refunds, Returns, Cancellations, Shipping & Insurance Policy**

Effective date: September 9, 2025

---

### **Scope**

This policy applies to physical bullion redemptions and any merchandise shipped by or on behalf of PBCEx. In-app trades and wallet transfers are covered separately in Section 9\.

---

### **Snapshot (plain-English summary)**

- In-stock items ship within 1–3 business days after funds clear. If we can’t ship on time, you’ll get a choice: accept a new date or receive a prompt refund. If no ship time is given, the FTC’s 30-day rule applies.

- Every parcel is insured while in transit. Orders over $1,000 require adult signature; insurance ends once the carrier records delivery/signature.

- Bullion cancellations/returns may incur “market loss” charges. Any market gain stays with PBCEx.

- Claims windows apply: FedEx (damage/missing ≤60 days; lost ≤9 months), UPS (claims ≤60 days), USPS (damage/missing ≤60 days; lost varies by service).

---

### **1\. Definitions**

- **Business Day:** Monday–Friday, excluding U.S. federal holidays. Orders after 3:00 p.m. ET count as placed the next business day.

- **Properly Completed Order:** Funds have cleared and all required checks are complete (identity/address verification if applicable).

- **Price Lock:** A \~10-minute dealer quote secured during checkout.

- **Adult Signature:** Carrier must obtain an adult’s signature on delivery.

- **Market Loss:** The difference between your locked price and our current ask at cancellation/return processing.

---

### **2\. Shipping Commitments & FTC MITOR Compliance**

- **Standard:** In-stock items ship within 1–3 business days. Pre-orders/backorders display an estimated ship-by date; that governs.

- **Delays:**
  - First delay with a definite new date ≤30 days: silence counts as consent.

  - First delay \>30 days or indefinite: silence is not consent; we cancel and refund.

  - Any later delay: requires your affirmative consent.

- **No stated ship-by time:** We ship within 30 days (50 if you applied for credit at checkout).

- **Refund speed:** 7 working days (cash/check/third-party credit); one billing cycle if we are the creditor. Store credit never substitutes for a required refund.

---

### **3\. Price Locks, Order Review & Cancellations**

- **Price Lock:** Orders are binding at the locked price once confirmed.

- **Your cancellation before shipment:** Fees may include (i) market loss and (ii) a processing fee (greater of $50 or 5% of order).

- **Our cancellation under MITOR:** Full, prompt refund with no market loss or fees.

- **Errors, supplier issues, fraud:** Orders may be cancelled if caused by quoting errors, supplier unavailability, or fraud checks. Refunds are prompt, with no additional liability.

- **Payment verification/holds:** Fraud prevention/compliance checks may delay shipment; MITOR clock starts once order is properly completed.

---

### **4\. Returns & Exchanges (Physical Metals)**

- **Change of mind:** Not available for bullion.

- **Defects/mistakes:** Contact us within 48 hours. Items may be replaced or refunded after inspection. Market loss may apply.

- **Condition standards:** Normal minting marks or minor abrasions aren’t defects. Altered packaging (capsules, assay cards) may void claims.

- **Non-bullion merchandise:** Apparel and similar items may be returned within 14 days if unused, unless otherwise stated.

- **RMA required:** All returns require an RMA and our prepaid insured label. Unauthorized returns may be refused.

---

### **5\. Shipping, Insurance & Signatures**

- **Carriers:** UPS, FedEx, or USPS, insured and at our discretion.

- **Adult Signature:** Required at ≥$1,000 and in flagged cases. Optional for lower-value orders.

- **No reroutes or release:** We cannot change address, waive signature, or authorize “leave at door” after dispatch. Any carrier release you sign transfers risk to you.

- **Split shipments & substitutions:** May occur at our discretion, at no extra cost.

- **Title & risk of loss:** Pass once the carrier records delivery/signature. Insurance ends then.

- **Shipping scope:** During MVP, U.S. addresses only. We may decline freight forwarders, virtual mailboxes, lockers, or other high-risk addresses.

---

### **6\. If Your Package Is Delayed, Lost, Damaged, or Marked “Delivered” but Not Found**

- **Lost in transit:** Contact us if tracking stalls. We’ll file with carriers promptly and keep you updated. Resolution occurs after carrier investigation (typically 10–15 business days).

- **Tampered/damaged at delivery:** Best practice: refuse delivery. If accepted, photograph everything and contact us within 48 hours. Retain packaging until instructed.

- **Marked delivered but not found:** Check delivery notes/photos, neighbors, and household. Report within 2 days. Porch piracy after valid delivery scan is not insured, but we’ll assist.

- **Cooperation:** You must provide photos, affidavits, or police reports if required for claims.

---

### **7\. Refused or Undeliverable Parcels**

Refused, unclaimed, or returned parcels due to incorrect addresses are treated as customer-initiated cancellations. Refunds (if any) are net of freight, carrier fees, market loss, and processing fees.

---

### **8\. Market Loss**

Market loss \= locked price minus current ask at cancellation/return processing. Any gain remains with PBCEx.

**Example:** You locked gold at $2,450/oz. If the current ask is $2,420/oz, you owe $30/oz × your order quantity.

---

### **9\. Refund Methods & Timing**

- Refunds issued to the original payment method where possible. If unavailable, we may use an equivalent method.

- Prompt refunds per MITOR: 7 working days for cash/check/third-party credit; within one billing cycle if PBCEx was the creditor.

- Shipping/insurance refunded if nothing shipped; proportional if partially shipped.

---

### **10\. Carrier Claim Windows**

- **FedEx:** Damage/missing ≤60 days; lost ≤9 months.

- **UPS:** Lost/damaged ≤60 days.

- **USPS:** Damage/missing ≤60 days; lost depends on service.

---

### **11\. Digital Assets, Swaps, and Wallet Transfers**

- In-app trades and conversions are final once executed.

- External transfers (blockchain, fiat rails) are irreversible and fees/spreads are non-refundable.

- Physical redemptions use a \~10-minute price lock checkout; once confirmed, this policy governs shipping and claims.

---

### **12\. Taxes & Compliance**

Applicable sales/use taxes are calculated at checkout. We comply with OFAC and sanctions/export rules. Orders that violate these laws may be cancelled.

---

### **13\. California Proposition 65**

Some items may expose you to chemicals, including lead or nickel, known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive harm. See www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.

---

### **14\. Force Majeure**

We are not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control (natural disasters, strikes, market halts, regulatory actions, outages, supplier shortages), except for refunds required by MITOR.

---

### **15\. Liability Cap; No Indirect Damages**

Maximum liability is limited to the amount you paid for the affected order. No incidental, consequential, special, or indirect damages are covered.

---

### **16\. Relationship to Terms of Service**

This policy is incorporated into and governed by the PBCEx Terms of Service, including arbitration and class-action waiver. If there’s a conflict, the Terms of Service control.

---

### **17\. Updates**

We may update this policy prospectively. The version in effect at your order time applies, unless law requires otherwise.
