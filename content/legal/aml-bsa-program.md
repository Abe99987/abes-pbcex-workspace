# **PBCEx, Inc. — Global AML & BSA Compliance Program**

**Effective Date:** September 11, 2025

---

## **Introduction and Scope**

PBCEx, Inc. (“PBCEx”) is a tokenized commodities exchange bridging real assets (e.g., gold, silver, oil) with digital finance. This Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Compliance Program is a formal, comprehensive framework designed to prevent illicit use of PBCEx’s services and ensure full compliance with global and local AML/CFT regulations. It covers operations across multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, European Union, Middle East/North Africa (MENA), and other regions (e.g., Singapore, Switzerland). The program applies to all PBCEx products and activities—including crypto asset trading, tokenized commodity transactions, fiat on/off ramps, peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers, and physical precious metal fulfillment—and will be updated as new markets and regulatory requirements emerge.

**Program Governance.** PBCEx’s AML program is risk-based and board-approved, meeting the “four pillars” (plus customer due diligence) of an effective compliance program. It is in writing and available for regulatory inspection. The program includes: (1) robust internal policies, procedures, and controls to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws; (2) appointment of a dedicated BSA/AML Compliance Officer with authority and resources to enforce day-to-day compliance; (3) ongoing training for all relevant personnel; (4) periodic independent testing of the program’s effectiveness; and (5) detailed Customer Due Diligence (CDD) measures, including customer identification and verification, beneficial ownership for business accounts, and enhanced due diligence for higher-risk customers.

**Enterprise-Wide Standards.** PBCEx enforces enterprise-wide AML standards that meet or exceed the strictest applicable laws. Where operating via third-party partners or franchisees, PBCEx ensures those agents adhere to this program (permitted by FinCEN’s rules on agent/principal AML responsibility allocation). Even when leveraging regulated partners for custody or payments (e.g., Anchorage Digital for crypto custody, Paxos for gold tokens, Stripe for fiat) during early phases, PBCEx remains responsible for its own AML controls. There is no “false reliance” on partner KYC—**all customers must clear PBCEx’s internal KYC and sanctions screening** at onboarding and on an ongoing basis. Compliance is viewed as a core competency and competitive advantage for PBCEx, aligned with our mission of bridging traditional assets and crypto responsibly. We sequence compliance milestones with business growth (e.g., using licensed partners initially, then obtaining our own licenses by Phase 3\) to ensure no gaps in coverage.

**Document Structure.** This document is organized by jurisdiction (U.S., EU, MENA, and other global regions) to detail specific statutory requirements, then by functional components of PBCEx’s AML program (customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, sanctions, etc.). Each jurisdictional section describes local laws, licensing triggers, reporting obligations, Travel Rule requirements, sanctions controls, and record-keeping rules. Subsequent sections provide global AML/CFT policies, standard operating procedures (SOPs) by function, training and audit plans, and risk mitigation strategies (including special “gotchas” and red-flag typologies relevant to PBCEx’s business). All policies and procedures herein are effective immediately and actionable day-one, with placeholders for future enhancements (e.g., local counsel review, regulatory license updates, or technology integrations) as PBCEx expands.

## **Jurisdictional Compliance Programs**

### **1\. United States (FinCEN / BSA Requirements)**

**Regulatory Status.** In the U.S., PBCEx operates as a Money Services Business (MSB) registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). As an MSB performing money transmission (accepting and transmitting value, including convertible virtual currency), PBCEx is subject to the full range of BSA/AML requirements. These include maintaining an AML program (as detailed in this document), filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs), adherence to recordkeeping and Travel Rule obligations for fund transfers, and compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. PBCEx will obtain state-by-state Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) as needed once it expands beyond operating under partner licenses. In Phase 1, by using a federally chartered trust (Anchorage) for custody and a regulated payments partner, we cover many licensing requirements; however, FinCEN MSB registration and AML program implementation are non-negotiable from day one. PBCEx has registered via FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing system (FinCEN Form 107\) and will renew that registration every two years as required.

**Risk-Based Controls & Governance.** The U.S. program is tailored to the firm’s risk profile in terms of products (crypto, tokenized commodities, fiat), customer base (retail and possibly institutional in future), and geographies (initially U.S.-domiciled users). We have implemented internal controls to ensure compliance with all applicable BSA regulations. Key components include automated identity verification at onboarding, ongoing transaction monitoring rules calibrated to detect suspicious patterns (e.g., structuring, rapid in-and-out asset conversions, use of mixers, etc.), and sanctions screening at multiple touchpoints (account creation, deposits/withdrawals, and periodically against updated OFAC lists). A U.S. Compliance Officer (BSA Officer) is appointed to oversee the day-to-day BSA program. This person’s duties include ensuring timely filing of BSA reports (SARs, CTRs), updating policies to reflect new regulations or guidance (e.g., FinCEN advisories), and training staff on U.S.-specific red flags (such as “pig butchering” crypto investment scam indicators or ransomware payment flows). The Compliance Officer has the authority to halt transactions or offboard customers that pose unmitigated risk. PBCEx’s Board of Directors receives regular AML reports and has approved this program, committing to a culture of compliance from the top down. Independent audits of the U.S. AML program will be conducted annually (or more frequently if risk dictates) by a qualified third party or an internal auditor independent of compliance management.

**Licensing Triggers.** Under U.S. law, engaging in money transmission or dealing in convertible virtual currency triggers MSB status (no minimum transaction threshold). PBCEx’s activities of receiving fiat or crypto from one person and transmitting value (even internally or to a third party) classify it as a money transmitter. As such, we maintain the FinCEN MSB registration and will pursue state MTLs. Additionally, if PBCEx’s commodities activities involve retail sale of physical metals, we monitor for any state “bullion dealer” licensing requirements. We note that cash transactions over $10,000 involving commodities would require Form 8300 filings by a dealer, but PBCEx does not anticipate large cash physical sales in Phase 1 (most metals are purchased via digital payment). If in future PBCEx offers any product that might be deemed a security (e.g., tokenized debt instruments or equities), we will either avoid those or obtain the necessary SEC-registered broker-dealer and exchange licenses. Similarly, if we enter into futures or derivatives on commodities or crypto, CFTC registration would be triggered, which we plan to avoid by sticking to fully funded spot-like products. Our legal and compliance team monitors these triggers to ensure PBCEx does not operate an unlicensed money transmission, securities business, or commodities exchange.

**Customer Identification (CIP) and KYC.** In the U.S., while banks have a formal Customer Identification Program (CIP) rule, MSBs are required under 31 CFR 1022.210 to verify customer identities to the extent reasonable and practicable. PBCEx’s policy is to collect and verify at minimum: the customer’s full legal name, date of birth, physical address, and identification number (e.g., SSN or passport/driver’s license number) for each person who opens an account. All customers must be at least 18 years old. We use documentary verification (government-issued photo ID) supplemented by non-documentary methods (database checks, selfie/face match, liveness checks) to ensure authenticity. For U.S. legal entity customers, we collect appropriate Know-Your-Business (KYB) information: articles of incorporation or equivalent, EIN, address, and we identify any beneficial owners with ≥25% ownership as well as a controlling person, per FinCEN’s CDD Rule (31 CFR 1010.230). These beneficial owners are verified similar to individual customers. PBCEx does not allow anonymous or unverified use of its platform; identity must be verified at onboarding before a customer can deposit or trade. (Our partners like Stripe or Anchorage may also perform KYC, but PBCEx independently requires all users to pass our internal KYC checks—reinforcing, not substituting, partner controls.) We retain all identification records for at least 5 years after an account is closed, in accordance with BSA recordkeeping rules.

**Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR).** PBCEx will file SARs with FinCEN for any transaction or attempted transaction of $2,000 or more that we know, suspect, or have reason to suspect involves funds derived from illegal activity, is intended to evade regulations (e.g., structuring), has no business or lawful purpose, or involves the use of PBCEx to facilitate criminal activity. (For certain cases involving insider abuse, SARs can be filed for any amount.) Our transaction monitoring system is configured to flag numerous red flags for compliance review—examples include: multiple rapid deposits just under $10k (possible structuring to avoid CTRs), frequent trading between crypto and commodities with no economic sense (could indicate layering), use of our P2P transfer feature among unrelated accounts (potential illicit layering), accounts receiving cryptocurrency from mixers or dark net markets, logins or transactions from high-risk geographies, and any customer appearing in law enforcement subpoenas or negative media. Upon an alert, the Compliance team performs enhanced investigation: gathering internal data (trading history, communication logs) and open-source intelligence. If suspicion is substantiated, the Compliance Officer reviews and, if appropriate, a SAR is electronically filed via FinCEN’s BSA E-filing within 30 calendar days of initial detection (with a 30-day extension to 60 days if we cannot determine suspect identity). SAR filings are kept confidential and not disclosed to the subject. PBCEx’s SAR internal procedure includes documenting the decision process when not filing (to evidence appropriate review). We also proactively consider whether to voluntarily share information under 314(b) with other financial institutions if that could aid in identifying money laundering—FinCEN strongly encourages this voluntary information sharing and provides safe harbor from liability. We have a 314(b) SOP (detailed later) to govern such exchanges, ensuring we only share with other registered 314(b) participants and use information only for permitted purposes.

**Currency Transaction Reporting (CTR).** Although PBCEx is primarily digital, any receipt or disbursement of over $10,000 in currency (cash or cash-equivalents as defined) in a single day by or on behalf of the same person will trigger a CTR (FinCEN Form 112\) filing within 15 days. This could occur if, for example, a future physical branch allows a customer to buy gold with more than $10,000 in cash, or withdraw cash from a fiat account. Our cash handling SOP (see Section 5\) includes measures to identify and aggregate multiple smaller cash transactions by related entities or the same individual that occur in one business day to prevent evasion by structuring. While Phase 1 does not anticipate cash dealings (only digital fiat via Stripe and metal shipments via insured carriers), we have CTR processes ready for Phase 2 when in-person branches/franchises may handle cash. All CTRs will be filed accurately with required details (customer information, amount, date, business location, etc.) and retained for 5 years.

**Funds Travel Rule Compliance.** PBCEx complies with the Travel Rule (31 CFR 1010.410 and 1022.410) for transmittals of funds. Under FinCEN regulations, we **collect, retain, and transmit required originator and beneficiary information for transfers of $3,000 or more**. This applies to both fiat wire transfers and crypto transfers since FinCEN has clarified that value transfers in CVC (convertible virtual currency) fall under the Travel Rule. For outgoing transfers (e.g., a customer withdrawing crypto or sending funds to another institution), PBCEx will include the following information with the transfer: the originator’s name, account number (or wallet address for crypto), address, identification number (or other identifier like date of birth), the amount and date of transfer, and the beneficiary’s name and account (or wallet) number. For incoming transfers, we will obtain and retain the same information if provided, and if any required info is missing, we have procedures to request it or refuse the transfer. All Travel Rule records are kept for at least 5 years. We have implemented a Travel Rule compliance solution to securely transmit this data to other VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers)—for example, we participate in the TRUST network or similar mechanism used by major exchanges to exchange Travel Rule data. **Gotcha:** Travel Rule thresholds—PBCEx staff are trained that the $3,000 rule for information transfer is separate from SAR/CTR thresholds, to avoid any misinterpretation. Even if a transaction is below SAR/CTR amounts, we still collect Travel Rule data at $3k. We also note that FinCEN proposed lowering the threshold for international crypto transfers to $250 in certain cases; our systems can adapt if U.S. regulations change. For now, we adhere to the $3,000 rule and also voluntarily apply Travel Rule practices to lower-value crypto transfers where feasible, as a best practice.

**OFAC Sanctions Screening.** As a U.S.-based business, PBCEx strictly complies with OFAC sanctions programs. We screen all customers and beneficial owners against the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list and other OFAC lists at onboarding and continuously (with nightly updates). Any potential match results in a hold on account opening until resolved (verified false hit or confirmed true match). We also screen all inbound and outbound transactions: cryptocurrency addresses and bank account details are checked against sanctions intelligence (e.g., known blocked wallet addresses linked to sanctioned parties). In line with OFAC’s 2021 guidance for the virtual currency industry, we implement geographic IP address blocking and other geolocation tools to prevent access from sanctioned jurisdictions. Specifically, we block any customer signup or login attempts originating from Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or any other OFAC-sanctioned country/region. Our systems also check for IP addresses associated with VPNs or TOR to mitigate attempts to bypass geo-blocking. If a customer is discovered to have ties to a sanctioned country (e.g., they are a resident of, or are physically located in, an embargoed region) or is a sanctioned individual/entity, their assets will be frozen and a report filed with OFAC (blocked property report within 10 business days, as required). We maintain OFAC screening records and will respond promptly to any OFAC inquiries or subpoenas. PBCEx also leverages blockchain analytics to detect exposure to sanctioned cryptocurrency addresses (e.g., if a deposit comes from a wallet that transacted with a North Korean hacker-linked address). Such events prompt immediate compliance review and potentially freezing of funds pending investigation. **OFAC Expectations:** PBCEx recognizes that OFAC expects proactive controls in this industry, such as screening IP and email domains, conducting sanctions list checks in real-time, and employee training on sanctions compliance. Our sanctions policy incorporates those elements, and we will conduct an annual OFAC-specific audit to ensure our controls remain effective.

**SAR/CTR Reporting to Law Enforcement.** In addition to standard SAR filing, PBCEx will respond to any 314(a) information requests from FinCEN (via the bi-weekly sensitive information requests sent to financial institutions) to search our records for subjects of money laundering or terrorism investigations. We have a point of contact to handle 314(a) requests securely and within the required 14 days (or 7 days for FinCEN’s requests related to terrorism). If PBCEx expands to maintain bank accounts or more traditional financial accounts, we will ensure full 314(a) procedures are in place. **314(b) Information Sharing:** As mentioned, PBCEx plans to participate in the voluntary 314(b) program to share information with other institutions about persons suspected of ML/TF. We have a policy and SOP (see Section 5\) for how we will obtain annual 314(b) registration, verify counterparties are also registered, and document any information exchanged. This collaborative approach can enhance detection of illicit networks (for instance, if we see a pattern that a user we terminated for suspicious activity pops up at another exchange, or vice versa, sharing info can help connect the dots).

**Recordkeeping and Retention (U.S.).** PBCEx keeps all BSA-required records for at least 5 years (and longer if required by state law or if we receive a legal hold notice). This includes SAR filings and supporting documentation, CTR filings, customer identification information, transaction records (ledgers, transfer details), and funds transfer records (Travel Rule data). We abide by 31 CFR 1010.430’s requirement to retain records in retrievable form. Additionally, as part of commodities dealing, we retain invoices and any related documentation for physical metal sales/shipments for at least 5 years. In the event of a law enforcement hold or subpoena, we implement a legal hold to preserve relevant records beyond normal retention schedules and will cooperate with U.S. authorities as needed.

### **2\. European Union (MiCA, AMLDs, and EBA Guidelines)**

**Regulatory Status.** In the EU, PBCEx will be an obliged entity under anti-money laundering laws as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) once it offers services to EU customers. Even before dedicated crypto regulation, the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) already brought “virtual currency exchange providers and custodian wallet providers” under AML/CFT laws as of 2020\. PBCEx’s activities (exchanging crypto and fiat, and potentially issuing a tokenized gold asset) squarely fall under this scope. Under MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)—which takes effect in 2024/2025—PBCEx would likely need authorization as a CASP to operate EU-wide. For example, if PBCEx issues a tokenized gold product, that token might be classified as an Asset-Referenced Token (ART) under MiCA, requiring authorization as an ART issuer and compliance with reserve, governance, and white paper obligations. Similarly, providing exchange or wallet services in the EU will require a CASP license (with ability to “passport” across member states). We anticipate establishing an EU subsidiary in Phase 3 and applying for the necessary MiCA authorizations and any national registrations (e.g., under each country’s AML regulator) during that phase. Until then, PBCEx may geo-restrict EU residents or operate only in limited ways (e.g., under another entity’s license or under no-action situations) to remain compliant. Our program, however, is designed to meet EU standards from inception so that expansion to Europe is streamlined.

**AML Directives Compliance.** PBCEx adheres to the principles of the EU AML Directives (5AMLD and 6AMLD). 5AMLD (Directive (EU) 2018/843) requires customer due diligence, recordkeeping, and suspicious activity reporting for crypto service providers similar to other financial institutions. 6AMLD (Directive (EU) 2018/1673) further harmonizes the definition of money laundering offenses (including cybercrime as a predicate) and extends criminal liability to legal entities for AML failures. We have incorporated these standards: for instance, recognizing cyber-related crimes (like hacking, ransomware) as predicates to money laundering and ensuring our risk assessment covers such threats (which aligns with FinCEN and FATF priorities as well). Under EU rules, we implement a risk-based approach to CDD: identifying and verifying all customers, plus performing enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk ones (e.g., customers from high-risk third countries, PEPs, or those with complex corporate structures). We also will comply with EU beneficial ownership registry requirements by collecting and potentially reporting corporate ownership information as required by local transpositions of AMLD5. PBCEx will file Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) with the relevant national Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in any EU country where it operates, in line with EU laws that require reporting of any suspicious transaction regardless of amount (no minimum threshold for STRs in the EU). Our internal processes for detecting suspicious activity are globally unified, but when an incident involves an EU customer or transaction, we will ensure an STR is filed through that customer’s jurisdictional FIU (e.g., using the goAML system or local FIU portal). We keep STRs confidential per EU law.

**Risk-Based Controls & EBA Guidelines.** The European Banking Authority (EBA) has issued extensive AML/CFT guidelines, including revised Guidelines on ML/TF Risk Factors that now explicitly cover CASPs. PBCEx incorporates this guidance: we assess risk factors such as the anonymity of crypto transactions, public vs. private wallet use, use of mixers/tumblers, geographic risk (e.g., customers or transactions linked to countries on the EU “high-risk third countries” list or FATF “black/grey lists”), and customer risk (e.g., if a customer is a politically exposed person (PEP) or acting as an unlicensed money service). For higher-risk scenarios, our program prescribes EDD measures like obtaining additional KYC information, verifying source of funds/wealth, senior management approval for onboarding, and more frequent account reviews. We also follow the EBA’s guidance for effective group-wide AML controls—meaning our EU compliance efforts will coordinate with our U.S. and other teams to ensure enterprise-wide visibility of risks. Notably, the EBA in 2023 extended its risk-factor guidelines to CASPs, which provide a non-exhaustive list of red flags and mitigating steps for crypto businesses. For example, the presence of “chain hopping” (rapidly converting one crypto to another), or a customer using multiple accounts to obscure fund origin, are factors flagged in guidance and thus in our monitoring rules.

**CASP Licensing and Governance.** Once licensed as a CASP under MiCA, PBCEx will have to meet governance standards such as fit and proper management, segregation of customer assets (for custody services), and prudential requirements for certain token issuers. We will designate a Compliance Officer at the EU entity level who will interface with EU regulators and ensure local regulatory reporting (e.g., to regulators and FIUs). PBCEx acknowledges the upcoming creation of an EU AML Authority (AMLA) that will oversee some cross-border institutions—we are prepared to engage with this regulator and undergo any required examinations of our EU operations. In the interim, we will likely register with local regulators (for example, Germany’s BaFin or France’s AMF for crypto registration) if offering services there before MiCA license passporting is available.

**Travel Rule in the EU.** The EU has implemented the FATF Travel Rule via the revised Transfer of Funds Regulation (EU) 2023/1113, which applies to crypto-asset transfers. As of December 2024, every crypto transfer involving a CASP must be accompanied by required originator and beneficiary information, with **no minimum threshold**. (The EU removed the €1,000 de minimis exemption, effectively setting a €0 threshold for Travel Rule data collection.) PBCEx’s systems will comply with this: for any transfer between PBCEx and another CASP (exchange or wallet provider) in Europe, we will transmit the required data: originator’s name, account number (or crypto wallet address), originator’s address/national ID or birth info, and beneficiary’s name and account number/wallet. We will also collect this information when receiving a transfer from a CASP. We have procedures to verify the information’s accuracy (for instance, ensuring names match our customer records) and to handle cases of missing/incomplete data—following EBA’s Travel Rule guidelines on what constitutes a “repeatedly failing” counterparty CASP and when to reject or restrict transactions. PBCEx will maintain records of all Travel Rule data for **8 years** (the EU requires at least 5 years retention, often extendable to 8 under national law; we choose 8 years to align with the longest requirement, e.g., in the UAE as well, and for consistency). We also comply with GDPR when handling this personal data—encrypting transfers of Travel Rule information and only using it for AML/CFT purposes. For transfers to/from unhosted (private) wallets, EU rules require CASPs to still obtain Travel Rule information from their customer and in some cases verify the ownership of the unhosted wallet for large transfers. PBCEx will implement processes (like wallet attestation or AOPP—Address Ownership Proof Protocol) if a customer in Europe wants to withdraw to their own wallet above relevant thresholds. We also apply enhanced monitoring and due diligence for transactions with unhosted wallets, as recommended by FATF and EBA, given the higher risk of those being linked to illicit use.

**Sanctions and EU Listings.** PBCEx will comply with EU sanctions (which include United Nations sanctions and EU autonomous sanctions). We screen customers and transactions against the EU’s consolidated financial sanctions list (in addition to OFAC, since many names overlap but we ensure both lists are covered). As part of EU law, we also must ensure no services are provided to persons on EU terrorist lists or those subject to asset freezes. Our sanctions screening tool incorporates EU listings and will be updated in real time. If any positive match is found involving an EU person, we will freeze assets and report to the competent authority in the member state (e.g., the national sanctions enforcement body). Moreover, because PBCEx will serve potentially cross-border EU clients, we will be mindful of EU Geo-IP expectations—while EU sanctions regimes are not as broad as OFAC’s country programs, there are regions like Crimea and entities in e.g., Russia or Iran that are sanctioned, so our geo-blocking covers those similar to the U.S. program.

**Cross-Border Recordkeeping (EU).** EU regulations (the Funds Transfer Regulation) require payment service providers (and now CASPs via the new rules) to verify the accuracy of originator information for transfers above €1,000 and to keep records of all information on the payer and payee. PBCEx will treat this as part of our Travel Rule process and maintain those records for 5+ years. We also ensure any cross-border correspondence with regulators or law enforcement (e.g., requests from one country’s FIU) are handled efficiently through our Compliance Officer. If PBCEx is not yet directly licensed in an EU country, we will still comply voluntarily with these data collection standards for any transactions involving EU persons, to be prepared and to demonstrate good faith compliance.

**Data Protection.** All personal data gathered for AML (KYC documents, transaction details) is processed under GDPR Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) and Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests in crime prevention). We maintain strong data security and will appoint a Data Protection Officer if required, given the sensitive data we handle in multiple jurisdictions.

### **3\. MENA Region (Middle East/North Africa)**

**Overview.** PBCEx’s phased global rollout includes a focus on MENA markets, particularly the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The regulatory environment in MENA is evolving rapidly for virtual assets. PBCEx’s AML program is Sharia-aware and aligns with Islamic finance principles, which is valuable in the region (discussed further under Sharia Compliance). We plan to approach each jurisdiction with requisite licensing and compliance from the start, or operate via sandbox programs in more nascent regimes.

**United Arab Emirates (UAE).** The UAE has a multi-layered regulatory structure for virtual assets: federal oversight through the Central Bank (CBUAE) and Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and specific regimes in financial free zones like ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) and DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre), plus Dubai’s dedicated Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) for the mainland and free zones outside DIFC. PBCEx intends to obtain the appropriate license depending on where we operate: e.g., a VARA license under Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulation Law (Law No. 4 of 2022\) if we set up in Dubai, or an FSRA license if in ADGM. Until then, we might limit UAE usage to pilot programs. Regardless, UAE AML laws (Federal Decree-Law No. 20 of 2018 and its Executive Regulation) will apply. PBCEx will comply with UAE’s AML/CFT requirements for VASPs, which include: full KYC for all customers, screening against UAE and international sanctions lists, reporting suspicious activity to the UAE’s FIU (the Financial Intelligence Unit) via the goAML system, and maintaining records for at least 5 years (extendable to 8 years). The SCA’s 2021 Guidance for Registered Virtual Asset Providers mandates robust systems for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and STR filing. Our program mirrors those expectations—e.g., any suspicious transaction or attempted transaction in the UAE will result in an STR filed on goAML without delay (no explicit minimum threshold, as suspicion alone triggers). UAE law also requires reporting cash transactions over certain thresholds (AED 55,000 for cash in trade or AED 60,000 for certain activities)—these may not directly apply to PBCEx’s digital model, but if we handle any cash in UAE branches, we will file Large Transaction Reports as needed. PBCEx will appoint a UAE Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) once operating there, as required by UAE law, and register that person with the UAE authorities.

**VARA and ADGM Rulebooks.** We will adhere to the specific rulebooks of VARA and ADGM’s FSRA. VARA’s Compliance and Risk Rulebook and Market Conduct Rulebook lay out requirements like conducting risk assessments, independent audit, and ongoing monitoring. ADGM’s AML Rulebook (mirroring FATF standards) will apply for any ADGM entity—it requires customer identification, screening, STR filings to the UAE FIU, and cooperation with ADGM’s Regulatory Authority. Both VARA and ADGM require Travel Rule compliance for VASPs: gathering and sharing originator/beneficiary information for virtual asset transfers. In practice, PBCEx’s Travel Rule solution (discussed above) will satisfy this—we will collect, verify, and transmit required sender/receiver data for any transfers involving UAE VASPs or customers, consistent with FATF Recommendation 16 and VARA/FSRA expectations. We also note that UAE expects VASPs to take a risk-based approach—focusing resources on higher risk situations (e.g., clients from sanctioned neighboring countries or with unusual transaction patterns). Our risk scoring model for customers incorporates regional risk factors (like customers from countries under MENA-FATF scrutiny, or involved in businesses susceptible to trade-based money laundering).

**Sanctions (UAE).** The UAE implements UN Security Council sanctions and its own local list (often overlapping with UN lists). PBCEx will screen against the UAE Central Bank’s sanctions list and automatically freeze any assets and file a report if a match is found, as per UAE Cabinet Decision 74/2020. We also comply with OFAC due to U.S. operations, but in UAE we ensure compliance with UAE sanctions law, including reporting to the Central Bank’s Financial Intelligence Unit within 24 hours of identifying any sanctioned party relationship. Additionally, geo-restrictions: we will not onboard individuals from countries under UAE boycott or sanction (per UAE policy). This will be integrated into our IP and residency checks.

**Saudi Arabia.** Saudi currently does not have a specific licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges—in fact, a government committee declared virtual currencies to be illegal for local institutions and warned the public against them. As such, PBCEx will not offer services in KSA to retail customers until regulations permit. However, we maintain awareness of Saudi AML/CFT laws (Anti-Money Laundering Law Royal Decree M/20 (2018) and implementing regulations). If in future Saudi opens a regulatory sandbox or licensing (perhaps via the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) or Capital Market Authority), PBCEx would only engage under an approved framework. In any case, any interaction with Saudi entities or funds will follow Saudi’s AML requirements: KYC for any Saudi institutional partners, screening against local Saudi terror lists, and STR filing to Saudi Arabia’s FIU (SAFIU) if we ever detect a Saudi nexus suspicious transaction. Since the current Saudi stance is prohibition, our compliance action is primarily preventative: blocking access from Saudi IP addresses, not marketing or onboarding Saudi residents, and ensuring we do not facilitate unauthorized crypto trading in the Kingdom. We understand that banks in Saudi are barred from crypto dealings without SAMA approval, so we will refrain from using any Saudi correspondent or banking channels for crypto-related flows. Should Saudi open up (e.g., via a new Digital Assets Law), PBCEx will pursue licensing and integrate any specific requirements (such as keeping a local office, Saudi citizen MLRO, etc.). Until then, Saudi-based customers will not be served, and any that slip through (e.g., by VPN) will be promptly off-boarded if discovered.

**Other GCC/MENA.** In other jurisdictions, PBCEx will comply with respective AML laws. For example, Bahrain has a crypto-asset framework under the Central Bank of Bahrain; Qatar forbids virtual asset services; Oman and Kuwait are developing regulations. We will evaluate each and either avoid providing services where illegal or obtain necessary approval. The program’s general principles (FATF-based controls) apply across all. We pay special attention to Hawala and cash-intensive trading which is more prevalent in the region: our AML training includes typologies of illicit finance common in MENA (like cash smuggling, trade-based money laundering involving gold or precious metals). For instance, we treat any request for physical gold delivery to a third-party or freight forwarder in the region as high risk (see Physical Delivery SOP) given known risks of gold being used to move value illicitly. We also plan to pursue Sharia compliance certification in later phases, which involves an independent review of our products for Sharia adherence—while not directly AML, it enhances our credibility in Islamic markets and ensures our profit models (no interest, fully-backed assets) do not conflict with religious laws. (AAOIFI—the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions—has issued a Shariah Standard on Gold which PBCEx already follows by enabling only spot, fully-reserved trades. This alignment means less informal or unrecorded dealings, indirectly aiding AML transparency.)

**Recordkeeping (MENA).** As mentioned, UAE requires up to 8 years record retention. We will abide by whichever is higher between local law and our global standard. For UAE and any future Saudi operations, we will keep customer and transaction records 10 years if mandated. We also maintain a local data storage solution if required by data localization laws.

### **4\. Other Global Jurisdictions**

**Singapore.** PBCEx will comply with Singapore’s Payment Services Act (PSA) and related AML notices. In Singapore, dealing in or facilitating exchange of Digital Payment Tokens (DPT) requires a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and triggers AML obligations under MAS Notice PSN02. If PBCEx onboarded Singapore customers or established a branch there, we would obtain a Major Payment Institution license for DPT services and fully implement MAS’s AML/CFT requirements, including: comprehensive customer due diligence (with thresholds for simplified vs. enhanced due diligence as defined by MAS), ongoing transaction monitoring, screening against MAS’s sanctioned and high-risk entity lists, and STR filing to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO). MAS Notice PSN02 requires identification of customers and beneficial owners, retention of records for at least 5 years, and timely reporting of suspicious activities (no minimum threshold). MAS technology risk management guidelines apply to protect data integrity.

**Travel Rule (Singapore).** MAS has implemented the Travel Rule with a threshold of SGD 1,500 for DPT transactions. For transfers ≥S$1,500 (\~US$1,000), PBCEx would collect and transmit originator and beneficiary information similar to U.S./EU requirements. MAS expects even transactions below that threshold to include basic identifiers (names and account numbers). We will send originator/beneficiary name and account details for small transfers, and full Travel Rule data at or above S$1,500. MAS requires due diligence on counterpart VASPs; PBCEx will maintain a whitelist of trusted VASPs and implement controls for unregulated counterparties (e.g., proof of wallet ownership).

**Switzerland.** Switzerland treats crypto businesses as financial intermediaries under its Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA). PBCEx, if servicing Swiss clients or operating an entity there, would either become directly supervised by FINMA or join a FINMA-recognized Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) like VQF for AML oversight. Swiss AML requirements include identifying customers and beneficial owners, monitoring transactions, and filing reports with MROS for reasonable suspicion. **FINMA Guidance 02/2019** requires VASPs to verify ownership of unhosted wallets for **all** crypto transfers (no de minimis threshold), and Travel Rule threshold is effectively CHF 0 for obliged institutions. PBCEx will implement technical controls (e.g., signed message / Satoshi test) if operating in Switzerland.

**Other Jurisdictions.** Canada (FINTRAC MSB), Australia (AUSTRAC registration), and the UK (FCA MLRs, UK Travel Rule) will be addressed before commencing operations in those regions. UK operations require an MLRO and a firm-wide AML risk assessment; PBCEx will prepare jurisdiction-specific addenda as needed.

## **Internal AML/CFT Policies and Procedures**

The following sections detail PBCEx’s internal policies by functional area and SOPs that implement those policies. These apply globally (with local adjustments). Deviations require Compliance Officer approval and documented rationale.

---

### **5\. Customer Due Diligence (KYC/KYB) Policy**

**Overview.** PBCEx performs thorough CDD on all customers to assess ML/TF risk—initial KYC, ongoing due diligence, and EDD as warranted. No anonymous accounts or transactions are permitted.

**Customer Identification Program.** Minimum for individuals: full name, DOB, residential address, government ID number; documentary verification (passport/ID) plus selfie/liveness; phone/email verification; and SSN/tax ID for U.S. persons. For non-U.S., local ID numbers (e.g., Emirates ID, PAN) are collected. Discrepancies trigger rejection or hold pending additional verification. No transactions until KYC approval.

**Business Customers (KYB).** Collect incorporation docs, EIN, business address, directors/signers, and beneficial owners ≥25% and controlling person(s). Perform KYC on each natural person and verify company registry records. High-risk business types require EDD and senior approval. Complex structures must be unraveled to ultimate beneficial owners; inability to identify UBOs results in refusal.

**Risk Profiling at Onboarding.** Initial risk rating (Low/Medium/High) based on country, occupation/business, volumes, source of funds, adverse media, and PEP status. PEPs require EDD, source of wealth, and senior approval; higher monitoring frequency applies.

**Name Screening.** Screen against sanctions lists (OFAC/UN/EU/others), law enforcement watchlists, PEPs, and adverse media at onboarding and periodically. Potential matches are reviewed and cleared/denied; true matches are rejected and reported as required.

**Ongoing CDD.** Periodic refresh of KYC and beneficial ownership; continuous monitoring for behavior inconsistent with profile; request source-of-funds documentation as needed.

**Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).** Triggers include PEPs, high-risk jurisdictions, opaque/cash-equivalent funding, frequent physical redemptions, repeated suspicious alerts. Measures include proof of source of funds/wealth, extended background checks, and management sign-off. Maintain comprehensive EDD files.

**Refusal/Termination Criteria.** Failure to complete CDD/EDD, refusal to cooperate, fronting, or prohibited/sanctioned activity leads to account denial or offboarding per SOP (with lawful funds disbursement as applicable).

**Reliance on Third Parties.** Generally disfavored; limited reliance (e.g., institutional referrals) only where legally permitted and with certifications. PBCEx remains responsible and conducts independent screening.

**Recordkeeping.** KYC/KYB and EDD records stored securely with role-based access. Retained ≥5 years post-relationship (longer where required).

---

### **6\. Transaction Monitoring & Suspicious Activity Escalation**

**Overview.** A combined real-time and batch monitoring program detects unusual activity across deposits, internal transfers (funding ↔ trading, P2P), trades, withdrawals, and physical redemptions. Case management and risk scoring prioritize alerts.

**Key Scenarios.**

- **Structuring:** deposits/withdrawals just under thresholds (CTR or Travel Rule).

- **Rapid in–out layering:** deposit → convert → withdraw in short windows to unrelated destinations.

- **Unusual P2P:** daisy chains, multiple unrelated counterparties, shared devices/IPs.

- **Mixer/darknet exposure:** inbound crypto from mixers or darknet-linked addresses.

- **Ransomware/sanctioned addresses:** inbound/outbound touching SDN-linked wallets.

- **Fiat anomalies:** high-risk corridors, repetitive returns/chargebacks.

- **Physical redemptions:** freight forwarders, inconsistent destinations, unusual frequency.

- **Device/location velocity:** improbable travel, multi-account device overlap.

- **Cross-asset obfuscation:** gold↔crypto conversion patterns indicative of laundering.

- **314(a) hits:** positive matches to law enforcement requests.

**Workflow.**

1. **Level 1** analyst review within SLA; gather internal/external intelligence.

2. Recommend close or escalate.

3. **Level 2/MLRO** decision (file SAR/STR, continue monitoring, restrict activity).

4. Draft, review, and file SAR/STR via proper portal.

5. Post-SAR decisions: maintain for monitoring or offboard per risk; supplemental SARs every 90 days if activity continues.

6. Documented “no SAR” decisions with rationale.

**Quality Control.** Supervisory review of closed alerts; 100% review of SARs pre-filing.

**FinCEN Priority Integration.** Rules aligned to anti-corruption, cybercrime/ransomware, TF, fraud (pig-butchering), transnational crime, drug/human trafficking, and proliferation financing.

**Continuous Improvement.** Back-testing, typology updates, independent testing findings integrated; feature/dev changes trigger scenario review.

---

### **7\. Sanctions Compliance Policy**

**Policy Statement.** Zero tolerance for sanctions violations; comply with U.S., UN, EU, UK, UAE, and other applicable regimes.

**Screening Practices.**

- **Onboarding:** SDN/consolidated lists, UN/EU/HMT, local lists; PEPs/adverse media context.

- **Ongoing:** daily rescreen of entire customer base.

- **Transactions:** screen fiat counterparties and crypto wallets; block listed wallets; geoIP blocking for comprehensively sanctioned regions; VPN/TOR detection; email/domain heuristics.

**Blocking/Rejecting.** Block assets or reject transactions as required; file blocked property reports (e.g., OFAC within 10 business days) and annual updates; freeze and report per EU/UAE processes.

**Reporting & SARs.** Mandatory sanctions reports are separate from SARs; suspicious evasion is SAR-worthy.

**Evasion Red Flags.** VPN circumvention, alias/orthographic variants, residency changes with inconsistent behavior, repeated attempts to route via permissive intermediaries.

**Dynamic Updates.** Near-immediate ingestion of new designations (e.g., mixers), policy updates, and emergency embargos.

**Global Consistency.** U.S. baseline plus additive local screening where stricter; unified list management.

**Access Controls/Documentation.** Strict SAR confidentiality; sanctions logs retained ≥5 years.

**Training & Testing.** Role-based sanctions training; periodic simulated sign-ups from prohibited geos; corrective actions tracked.

---

### **8\. P2P Transfers and Internal Wallet Controls**

**Overview.** Internal off-chain transfers (Funding → Funding) are fast and fee-less but monitored closely.

**Eligibility & Limits.** P2P only for fully KYC’d users; daily/monthly caps; recipient-count caps; jurisdictional availability gating; Funding-account only for traceability.

**Transparency/Records.** Full audit trail (sender, recipient, date/time, amount, asset) retained ≥5 years; internal records align with 31 CFR 1010.410(e) principles.

**Monitoring.** Alerts for large relative transfers, daisy chains, device/IP overlaps, dormant-to-pass-through behavior; suspected mule networks frozen and escalated.

**Usage Policy.** Personal/non-commercial; no unlicensed money transmission; ToS prohibits illicit use; violations lead to offboarding and SARs.

**Manual Controls.** Suspend P2P privileges or freeze specific transfers pending investigation; reversible within the ledger when timely.

**Cross-Border Internals.** Logged and reportable on request; internal data suffices for Travel Rule context; compliance tracks inter-region volumes.

**Multiple Accounts.** One personal account per user; device fingerprinting to detect multi-account abuse; violators offboarded.

**Testing & Audit.** Simulated suspicious P2P patterns; independent review of sampled P2P cases.

---

## **Conclusion**

This AML & BSA Program reflects PBCEx’s commitment to the highest standards of compliance as we build a global crypto-commodities exchange. By implementing strong customer due diligence, monitoring, reporting, and training across jurisdictions—and by anticipating regulatory expectations (including Travel Rule compliance and emerging risks like ransomware and DeFi abuses)—PBCEx aims to meet and exceed baseline legal requirements. A hardened AML program is essential for securing licenses, passing audits, and protecting our business and community from illicit exploitation.

The program is reviewed and approved by senior management and the Board. It will be updated at least annually, or sooner with significant regulatory or business changes. Certain sections include placeholders for jurisdiction-specific licensing or counsel input; these will be finalized as we engage local counsel during phased rollout. Meanwhile, the core policies and procedures herein are effective immediately.

PBCEx remains open to continuous improvement: feedback from regulators, independent testers, and industry best practices will be incorporated to keep the program effective and current. By adhering to this program, PBCEx’s staff and partners safeguard platform integrity, contribute to combating financial crime, and uphold the trust of customers and regulators worldwide.
