# **PBCEx Privacy Choices and Rights**

## **Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information**

Effective Date: September 10, 2025 (Updated for CPRA and latest state laws)

## Introduction

At PBCEx, we value your privacy and want to make it easy for you to understand and exercise your rights. This “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” policy explains how you can control the use of your personal data. We explain your rights under various privacy laws – from U.S. federal regulations, to state laws (like California’s CCPA/CPRA, Virginia’s CDPA, etc.), and international laws (like the GDPR in Europe and PIPEDA in Canada). Our goal is a friction-free, transparent experience: plain language where possible, with legally required details included for clarity. In summary, PBCEx does not sell your personal information for profit, and we only share it with trusted partners to operate our crypto and commodities exchange. If you want to limit any sharing or certain uses of your data, we honor those requests promptly (usually within 15 business days for opt-outs) and without hassle. This page will guide you through your choices, including how to:

• Opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information (e.g., for targeted advertising)

• Limit the use of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) (such as financial account info or government IDs)

• Use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) or similar signals to automatically communicate your opt-out preference

• Understand state-specific rights (California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, etc.) and how to exercise them

• Learn about our handling of authorized agent requests, verification steps for your protection, and our response timelines

• Find out how we manage cookies and implement a Consent Management Platform (CMP) for easy preference management

• See how we protect international users with cross-border data safeguards and a clear disclaimer

Please read on to learn more about your privacy choices at PBCEx. If you have any questions, you can always contact us at privacy@pbcex.com (or through your account settings). We’re here to help.

## U.S. Federal Privacy Practices

No General Federal “Do Not Sell” Law: The United States does not yet have a single comprehensive federal consumer privacy law granting a universal “do not sell my info” right. However, PBCEx complies with federal regulations that do apply to our services, and we adhere to guidance from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect your data. We consider privacy part of our commitment to fair and transparent business practices (the FTC can enforce against unfair or deceptive privacy practices).

Financial Privacy (GLBA): Because PBCEx deals with financial assets (crypto, tokenized commodities, etc.), we may be subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) for financial institutions. If applicable, we will provide you with a clear financial privacy notice explaining how we share your personal financial information and your right to opt out of certain sharing with third parties. For example, GLBA generally lets you opt out if we were to share your account information with non-affiliated companies for their own use (outside of providing services to your account). PBCEx will tell you about our information-sharing practices and honor any GLBA opt-out rights, in addition to the choices described in this policy.

Other Federal Laws: PBCEx complies with other federal privacy-related laws as relevant: for example, we follow anti-money-laundering (AML) rules that require collecting certain data (and protecting it), but we use that information only for compliance purposes. If we send marketing emails, we abide by CAN-SPAM (you can unsubscribe at any time). If we were ever to serve individuals under 13 (we do not – our services are for adults), we would comply with COPPA for children’s privacy. In short, even without an all-encompassing federal privacy law, we strive to respect your privacy rights and give you control over your personal information.

Your Choices (Federal): Aside from specific laws like GLBA, your primary privacy choices in the U.S. come from state laws (see next section). However, no matter where you’re located, PBCEx’s policy is not to sell your personal information to data brokers or marketers. We use your data to provide and improve our services, and share it only with service providers or partners as needed – all in ways that respect your privacy. The sections below describe these practices in detail and how you can exercise your rights.

## State-Specific Privacy Rights (USA)

Various U.S. states have enacted consumer privacy laws that give you specific rights over your personal information. PBCEx extends applicable rights to you based on your state of residence. In many cases, we offer the same core privacy choices to all users for simplicity and fairness. Below we break down key rights by state:

### California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a California resident, you have robust rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). Here’s what that means for you:

• Right to Know: You can request that we disclose the personal information we have collected about you, including the categories of data, sources, purposes, and third parties we share it with. You can request specific pieces of information we have about you (up to twice a year, free of charge). We will provide this in a portable format once we verify your identity.

• Right to Delete: You may request that we delete personal information we collected from you. Upon a verified request, we will delete your data from our records (and instruct our service providers to do the same), unless an exception applies (for example, if we need to keep certain data to comply with law, prevent fraud, or complete a transaction you initiated).

• Right to Correct: If you believe we hold inaccurate personal information about you, you can ask us to correct it. Once verified, we will correct the inaccurate information in our systems.

• Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing: You have the right to tell us “Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information.” We will not sell your personal data, and if you opt out, we will also stop any “sharing” of your data for cross-context behavioral advertising. Under CPRA, “selling” means sharing your information with third parties for valuable consideration (not necessarily money), and “sharing” means disclosing it for targeted advertising purposes. PBCEx does not sell customer data for money, and we do not share your data with third-party advertisers except as described below. If in the future we consider any practices that could be deemed a “sale” or “sharing,” we will provide a clear opt-out. By default, we treat all users as opted-out of any sale of personal information. If you want to ensure we never share your data for behavioral ads, you can use the mechanisms described below (the link, account settings, or GPC signal) to formally opt out. Once you opt out, we will honor it within 15 business days and will not resume selling/sharing unless you later request to opt back in (and we won’t even ask you to opt back in for at least 12 months).

• Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information: California residents can direct us to limit the use and disclosure of “Sensitive Personal Information” (SPI). SPI includes data like your Social Security number, driver’s license or passport number, financial account login, precise geolocation, racial or ethnic origin, health data, etc. PBCEx may collect some sensitive info as part of providing our services – for example, we might collect your government ID or Social Security number during account verification (KYC), or financial account info via Plaid when you link a bank, which is considered sensitive. We only use such sensitive data as necessary to serve you (e.g., to verify your identity, comply with legal obligations, process transactions, prevent fraud, or facilitate your requests). We do not use your sensitive data for purposes like targeted advertising or building profiles on your sensitive traits. Therefore, by default, we treat sensitive information with heightened protection and minimal use. If you still prefer to formally limit our use of your SPI, you can click the “Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information” link (on our homepage or in your account privacy settings). Using that right will ensure we only use your sensitive data for strictly necessary purposes (which, as noted, is already our standard practice). We will also inform our service providers of your choice as needed.

• Right to Equal Service (Non-Discrimination): We will not deny you service, charge you a different price, or provide a lesser experience because you exercised your privacy rights. At most, if certain data is needed for a feature (e.g., if you ask us to delete certain data, you might not be able to use a related feature anymore), we will inform you of the impact. But we won’t punish you for making a privacy choice.

### How to Exercise California Rights

• Online Form / Links: We provide a self-service “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on our website footer and within your account settings. Clicking that link will take you to a simple form or toggle where you can opt out of sale/sharing of your data. We also provide a “Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information” link in the same places, per CPRA requirements. These choices can often be made in your profile privacy preferences as well, for your convenience.

• Global Privacy Control (GPC): We honor the Global Privacy Control signal automatically. GPC is a browser setting or extension that notifies websites of your privacy preference (it’s like a universal “Do Not Sell/Share” signal). If our site or app detects a GPC signal from your browser, we will treat it as a valid opt-out of sale/sharing for that browser/device, without you needing to click anything. In other words, if you’ve enabled GPC, we’ve got you covered.

• Email or Phone: You may also email us at privacy@pbcex.com with your request, or call our toll-free privacy line at \+1-833-437-2239 (+1-833-43-PBCEx). Simply let us know you are a California resident exercising CCPA rights and what you would like to do (opt-out, delete, etc.). While we provide these channels, using the dedicated online form or your account settings is usually fastest and easiest.

• Verification (for Know/Delete/Correct requests): For your security, if you request to know, delete, or correct data, we will need to verify your identity. If you are a registered user, the simplest way is to submit the request from within your logged-in account, which serves as verification. If you submit via email/phone, we may ask you to provide some information that we have on file (such as your account email, recent transaction detail, or other identifier) to match against our records. We will never ask for sensitive info just to process a request (for example, we won’t ask for your password; and for an opt-out of sale/sharing request, we won’t require any information beyond what’s necessary to identify your data, if even that). Opt-out of sale/sharing requests do not require exhaustive verification – we will honor an opt-out on the browser or account it’s requested for, and if we need more info (say, to ensure we apply it to the correct account), we’ll ask minimally necessary details. If we cannot verify a deletion or access request, we will let you know and treat it as a request to opt out of sale instead.

• Authorized Agent Requests: You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights for you (for example, you might use a third-party privacy service, or ask an attorney or someone you trust). We will process agent-submitted requests once the agent’s authority is verified. For opt-out of sale/sharing requests, a simple letter or document signed by you is sufficient. If an agent requests access, deletion, or correction of your data, we may additionally ask you to either verify your identity with us directly or confirm directly that you gave the agent permission (this prevents fraud). Note: If an authorized agent uses an automated browser signal like GPC set up on your device, that signal will be honored without additional documentation.

### Timing

When you submit an opt-out of sale/sharing via any method, PBCEx will stop the sale/sharing of your personal information as soon as feasibly possible, and at latest within 15 business days from the date of your request. We will also notify any third parties who received your data in a sale or sharing context in the past and instruct them to stop further selling/sharing your data (and to forward that request down the line). For deletion or access requests, we will confirm receipt within 10 business days and respond within 45 calendar days as required by CCPA (with an extension of up to another 45 days if necessary, which we’ll communicate to you). Once you’ve opted out, we will not ask you to re-consent for at least 12 months. If you wish to opt back in to any sale/sharing (for example, perhaps to receive personalized ads or offers), you can always do so by adjusting your preferences – but that’s 100% your choice.

### Notice of Financial Incentive

PBCEx does not offer “financial incentives” in exchange for your data in any way that would require a special notice. We don’t sell your data, so we don’t have a program like “get a discount if we can sell your info.” If that ever changes, we will provide a proper notice and obtain your opt-in consent as the law requires.

### Our Data Sharing Practices (California Disclosures)

In our Privacy Policy we detail the categories of personal information we collect and how we use/share them. In brief: we collect identifiers (like name, contact info), customer records (like account balances), commercial information (transactions), internet activity (if you use our website/app), geolocation (approximate, from IP), professional or employment info (if you provide it for verification), and in some cases characteristics of protected classifications (through government IDs) – all for the purposes of providing our services and complying with law. We do not sell this information to third parties for money. We do share some information with third parties in ways that might be considered “sharing” (for behavioral advertising) under CPRA’s broad definitions, but we minimize such practices. For example, we might use analytics cookies or a marketing partner to analyze usage or retarget ads for our services – that could be deemed “sharing” under CPRA because the partner might use your browsing info to help serve ads. If we do this, those partners are considered “third parties” (not service providers) and we will honor opt-out signals to stop any such data flow. On the other hand, most of our data sharing is with service providers or contractors – companies that we contract and that only use your data to provide services to us, not for their own purposes. Sharing data with service providers (like our cloud hosting, ID verification service, payment processor, etc.) is not considered a sale or sharing under the CCPA because of our contractual agreements. For instance, if we share your info with our custodian partner to hold your assets, that partner is bound to use the info only for that purpose and not to monetize it themselves. Below are some key partners we use and what for – none of these count as “selling” your data:

• Plaid (financial data API): when you connect your bank or funding source, you enter your credentials through Plaid. Plaid shares with us the necessary account info (like account numbers, balances) to link your account, and we share identifying information with Plaid to facilitate this. Plaid acts as a service provider – it uses your data only to provide the bank-connection service and is not allowed to sell or reuse it.

• Stripe (payment processor): if you use a credit/debit card or certain payment methods, Stripe will receive your card details and personal info needed to process payments or payouts. Stripe is contractually bound to use that information only for payment processing and compliance (they don’t sell it).

• Paxos & Anchorage (custody and asset partners): These partners help us custody assets (cryptocurrency, tokenized gold, etc.). If you hold PAX Gold (PAXG) or other assets through PBCEx, we may share your identifying info and holdings with Paxos or Anchorage to manage your assets securely. They operate under strict regulations and contracts – they won’t use your info except as required for custody and regulatory compliance.

• TradingView & CoinGecko (market data providers): We may integrate charts (TradingView) or price data (CoinGecko) into our platform. When we do so, limited information like your IP address or device info might be visible to these providers as you load data (similar to how visiting any web widget works). We do not send them personal details like your name or account info. They collect usage data for analytics on their side, but this is generally controlled via cookies (which you can opt out of via our cookie preferences, described later) and they do not get to “sell” your personal info. We treat these as third-party integrations, so if you opt out of tracking (or use GPC), we will restrict what data is shared (for example, disabling third-party analytics cookies).

• JM Bullion & FedEx (fulfillment partners): If our services allow you to redeem a token for physical commodities (e.g., trading a gold token for actual gold delivery), we partner with logistics companies. JM Bullion might supply the physical metal, and FedEx (or similar couriers) deliver it. In such cases, we would share only the necessary data (your name and shipping address, and contents for insurance) to fulfill your request. These parties use the info only to fulfill the order and shipping – not to market to you unrelatedly. This falls under a “business purpose” disclosure (service provider context) rather than a sale.

Finally, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code §1798.83), California customers may request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. PBCEx’s policy is that we do not share personal data with third parties for their independent direct marketing without your consent. If you have specific questions, you can contact us for a Shine the Light report.

Virginia Privacy Rights (VCDPA)

Virginia’s CDPA gives Virginia residents rights similar to California’s, with some differences in terminology. If you reside in Virginia, you have the right to:

• Confirm Access (Right to Know)

• Correct

• Delete

• Data Portability

• Opt-Out of (i) sale, (ii) targeted advertising, and (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects.

We do not sell personal data for money, and we do not engage in cross-site behavioral advertising targeted at individuals. If that ever changes, we will enable a clear opt-out. We treat Virginia users as opted-out of any sale of data.

Exercising Rights (VA): Use the same web forms or contacts described above. We also voluntarily honor GPC as an opt-out signal for Virginia residents.

Appeals: If you are not satisfied with our action on your privacy request, email privacy@pbcex.com with the subject “Appeal of Privacy Request.” We will respond within 60 days with a written explanation of our decision.

### Colorado Privacy Rights (CPA)

Colorado residents have rights to access, correct, delete, and obtain a portable copy of their data, and to opt out of sale, targeted advertising, and certain profiling. “Sale” in Colorado includes exchanges for monetary or other valuable consideration (closer to California). We honor universal opt-out mechanisms like GPC for Colorado residents. Use the same request methods noted above; our appeal process mirrors Virginia’s.

### Connecticut Privacy Rights (CTDPA)

Connecticut provides similar rights to access, correct, delete, portability, and to opt out of sale, targeted advertising, and profiling. We obtain consent for sensitive data processing as applicable and honor universal opt-out signals like GPC.

### Utah Privacy Rights (UCPA)

Utah provides rights to access, delete data you provided, and obtain a portable copy, plus opt-outs for sale (monetary only) and targeted advertising. While Utah’s law is narrower, we provide strong privacy choices consistently. Use our web links, email, or toll-free number to exercise your rights.

### Other States

Several other states (e.g., Iowa, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada) have privacy laws in effect or coming online. We monitor these and extend similar rights as applicable. Regardless of location, if you contact us with a privacy request, we will do our best to honor it in accordance with applicable law.

⸻

## International Privacy and Data Transfer

### European Union/EEA & United Kingdom (GDPR)

If you are in the EU/EEA or UK, you have GDPR rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict/object to processing, and data portability. We do not share your personal data with third parties for their own purposes without a lawful basis. Where we rely on consent (e.g., cookies or marketing), you can withdraw it at any time.

### Lawful Bases & Transfers

We process data under lawful bases including contract performance, legal obligation (e.g., AML/KYC), and legitimate interests (e.g., platform improvement, fraud prevention). If we transfer personal data from the EU/UK to the U.S. or other countries, we implement safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses and, where applicable, participation by vendors in recognized transfer frameworks. We strive to provide comparable protection to your data even when processed outside your region.

### Your Choices (EU/UK)

Contact privacy@pbcex.com to exercise GDPR rights. We do not make fully automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects without human review.

### Canada (PIPEDA)

We obtain consent for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information except where permitted by law. You may access and request correction of your personal information. Data may be transferred outside Canada (e.g., to the U.S.) and will be protected by contractual and technical measures.

### Other International Regions

We do not sell personal information. We honor reasonable requests to access, delete, or limit processing even where not legally mandated, subject to applicable law. If you are outside the U.S., your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries; by using PBCEx, you consent to these transfers consistent with this policy and our Privacy Policy.

### International Disclaimer

This page aggregates rights and practices across jurisdictions. If there is any conflict between this page and rights provided by your local law, we will follow the law.

⸻

## Cookies, Tracking, and Opt-Out Preference Signals

### Cookie Notice & Consent

When you visit PBCEx’s website or app, you will see a cookie banner that lets you accept, reject, or customize non-essential cookies (analytics/advertising). Where required, non-essential cookies will not load until you consent. You can adjust preferences anytime via a “Cookie Preferences” link in our footer.

### Consent Management Platform (CMP)

We use a Consent Management Platform to present choices, record preferences, and automatically enforce them (blocking non-essential scripts until consent). In opt-out jurisdictions (e.g., California), our CMP also respects “Do Not Sell/Share” choices.

### Cookies and “Do Not Sell/Share”

Cookie controls govern collection; “Do Not Sell/Share” governs downstream use. We support both: turning off analytics/advertising cookies via the banner and disabling any sale/sharing via our Do Not Sell/Share mechanism.

### Global Privacy Control (GPC)

We fully support GPC. If your browser sends a GPC signal, we treat it as a valid opt-out of sale/sharing for that browser/device and align our cookie behavior accordingly. Logged-in users’ GPC preferences will be applied to their account where feasible.

### “Do Not Track” (DNT)

Because DNT never became a standard, we do not respond specifically to DNT signals. Use GPC or our on-site controls for reliable opt-outs.

### Analytics and Advertising

We use limited analytics to improve the platform and may use limited advertising/retargeting for our own services. You can opt out of analytics/advertising cookies via the banner. Embedded third-party widgets (e.g., TradingView charts) may set their own cookies; our CMP categorizes and controls these where they are not strictly necessary.

### Friction-Free Experience

Our banner provides “Reject All” alongside “Accept All.” The “Do Not Sell/Share” link performs a direct opt-out without requiring an account. Logged-in users can toggle these settings in their profile.

### Opt-Out Confirmation

After you opt out, you’ll see confirmation and your preference will be saved (in your account and/or browser). If you clear cookies, you may need to reset browser-based preferences; account-based preferences persist.

⸻

## Additional Information and Contact Details

### Response Times

We strive to process opt-outs within 15 business days and most other requests within 45 calendar days (extensions communicated as permitted by law). You will receive confirmation and a reference number for your request.

### No Account Needed

You do not need a PBCEx account to submit a Do Not Sell/Share opt-out. If you are only browsing our marketing site, you can use the GPC signal or cookie banner without providing personal information.

### Authorized Agent (Recap)

Authorized agents may submit requests on your behalf. We verify agent authority and may ask for minimal information to protect against fraud.

## Changes to This Policy

We will update the Effective Date and post a notice if we make significant changes to our Do Not Sell/Share practices or this page.

## Cross-Border Data & Security

We implement encryption in transit/at rest, access controls, and vendor due diligence. If a data breach posing a risk to you occurs, we will notify you and regulators as required.

When contacting us, please provide your name, contact info, and the nature of your request or question. If you are exercising a specific right, please describe it (e.g., “Access Request – GDPR” or “Do Not Sell Opt-Out – California”) so we can direct it appropriately. We will respond as promptly as we can, and within the timeframes required by law.

Thank you for trusting PBCEx. We are committed to earning that trust by handling your personal information with care and transparency. This “Do Not Sell or Share” page is part of that commitment – empowering you with knowledge and control.

Your privacy choices are saved and honored. If you opted out of sale/sharing, that choice remains in effect unless you change it. If you limited use of sensitive info, we abide by that. And if you have any concerns, we’re here to help.
