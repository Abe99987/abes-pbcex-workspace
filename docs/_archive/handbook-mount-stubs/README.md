# Handbook Mount

This is a **mirror surface** for dragging canonical markdown files from external sources. The canonical documentation lives elsewhere - these are working copies only.

## Purpose

- **Business Plan**: Strategic docs and planning materials
- **Architecture**: System design and technical specifications
- **Legal**: Compliance, terms, and legal documentation
- **Prompts**: Cursor and AI prompting templates
- **Decision Log**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Usage

Drag and drop markdown files into the appropriate subdirectories. Each section has its own README with specific guidance.

**Note**: This is not the canonical source - treat as a working mirror for easy access during development sessions.
